## How it works

The Kogge-Stone adder is a parallel prefix adder. 
Comparing with the conventional ripple-carry adder, it is more efficient.
It utilizes the GENERATE and PROPAGATE signals to calculate each CARRY in advanced to reduce the carry propagation delay.

The block diagram of the Kogge-stone adder is shown below [1].
